EXPENSE CATEGORIES DROPDOWN - QUICK FIX GUIDE
==============================================

ISSUE: Expense categories dropdown is empty when adding expenses

SOLUTION: Run Django migrations to populate the expense codes

STEPS:
------

1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the palmcash project:
   cd palmcash/palmcash

3. Run migrations:
   python manage.py migrate

4. Verify the fix:
   - Log in as a manager
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Click "Add Expense"
   - Check that the "Expense Category" dropdown now shows:
     * Cleaning costs
     * Stationery
     * Rentals
     * Talk time
     * Transport

WHAT WAS FIXED:
---------------
- Created migration file: expenses/migrations/0004_populate_expense_codes.py
- This migration automatically creates 5 predefined expense categories
- The categories are now available in the dropdown menu

ALTERNATIVE METHOD:
-------------------
If migrations don't work, you can run the setup command:
   python manage.py setup_expense_codes

SUPPORT:
--------
If the dropdown still doesn't show after running migrations:
1. Check that migrations ran successfully (no errors)
2. Verify database connection is working
3. Check that you're logged in as a manager user
4. Clear browser cache and refresh the page
